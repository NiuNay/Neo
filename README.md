# Neo

Neo is a webapp that allows clinicians to track the blood glucose levels of premature babies.

The application runs on a local server and stores the data on in MongoDB (NoSQL) locally. 

In order to run the applicaton, first download MongoDB Community Service at https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community

Once downloaded, create a database with the name "HospitalRecords", with Collection Name "Babies"

In your IDE, run the "NeoApplication" class. This sets up the local server and connects the HospitalRecords Database in MongoDB to the application.
